AtmosFeel is an advanced weather monitoring tool application that leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to deliver real-time and forecasted weather data. This API is integral to the application through offering detailed insights into current weather conditions, hourly updates, and long-term weekly forecasts. OpenWeatherMap stands as a leader in digital weather services as it provides robust, scalable, and freely available APIs that allow developers to integrate accurate weather data into their applications effortlessly. For more information on the capabilities and usage of this API, please visit the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api).

In addition to leveraging external weather data, AtmosFeel incorporates SQLite for effective local data management. This database system is renowned for its minimal configuration, transactional integrity, and full-featured, SQL support. SQLite is utilized within AtmosFeel to store and manage user data and preferences, particularly the information displayed on the application's interactive third tab.

The application itself is developed using Java, a choice driven by the language's platform independence, robust security features, and extensive library support, which makes it particularly suited for creating reliable and maintainable applications.
